Bootzooka's stack consists of the following technologies/tools:

*	Scala (JVM based language)
*	Scalatra (simple web framework to expose JSON API)
*	H2 DB (persistence)
*	Slick (query SQL database using strictly typed DSL)
*   Flyway (easy schema evolution)
*	AngularJS + HTML5 (browser part)
*	SBT & Grunt.js (build tools)
*   Swagger - for interactive API docs

### Why Scala?

A lot of the projects that we develop at [Softwaremill](http://softwaremill.com) are written in Scala. It's our
default go-to language for server-side. Softwaremill is also a [Typesafe](http://typesafe.com/) partner.

### Why AngularJS?

Basically it's the hottest JavaScript framework right now, developed and supported by Google and we use it a lot
in [SoftwareMill](http://softwaremill.com) (also because it's really good). It offers a complete solution to
build dynamic and modern HTML5 based web applications.

### Why Scalatra?

It's quite simple and easy to jump into Scalatra both for Java and Scala developers. The syntax of the flow directives
is straightforward and it was easy to integrate support for JSON into it. And it's written in Scala from scratch, hence
seamlessly integrates with other Scala based libraries.

### Why SBT and Grunt?

To put it simply, SBT is the build tool of choice for Scala, Grunt - for JavaScript.
