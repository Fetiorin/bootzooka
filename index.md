Bootzooka is a simple application scaffolding project to allow quick start of development for modern web based
applications.

It contains only the very basic features, that almost any application needs (listed below). These features are fully
implemented both on server- and client- side (as a Single Page Application). The implementations can also serve
as blueprints for new functionalities.

Current user visible features:

*	User registration
* Lost password recovery (via e-mail)
*	Logging in/out
* Profile management

This may not sound "cool", but in fact Bootzooka is really helpful when bootstrapping a new project. This is because
besides of the features mentioned it contains the whole required setup and automation of build processes both for
frontend and backend. You get it out of the box which means significantly less time spent on setting up infrastructure
and tools and more time spent on actual coding features in project.
